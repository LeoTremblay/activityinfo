# ActivityInfo Informational Site

## Developing

For now, just edit the static html documents in src/main/webapp. Next step will be to set up a proper template
workflow for blogs, etc.

To preview the site, run

    gradle appengineRun
    
   
And then browse to http://localhost:8080

Refresh your browser to see changes to the html documents.
